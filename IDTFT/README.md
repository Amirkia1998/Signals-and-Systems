# Inverse Discrete-Time Fourier Transform
The inverse discrete-time Fourier transform (IDTFT) is defined as the process of finding the
discrete-time sequence x(n) from its frequency response X(Ï‰).


## Description
Find the n-plane equivalent of the square wave whose 
frequency representation is given below, using the 
discrete-time inverse fourier transform (IDTFT). 
For this process, make the analytical solution in your own handwriting 
and attach the photo of your solution to your report.
