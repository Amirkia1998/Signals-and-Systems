# Syntehtic Vowel
In this homework, we will synthesize this synthetic vowel by using the complex amplitudes 
given in Table 1 for relevant frequency values in MATLAB.

## Description
In Table 1, the numerical values of the complex amplitudes (Xk) for a synthetic vowel ‘ah’ are 
given. ak’s are the complex coefficients of harmonics in Cartesian coordinate system and ‘Mag’ 
and ‘Phase’ values are the amplitude and angle values of harmonics in polar coordinate system.

This synthetic vowel can be modelled as the sum of 5 real sinusoidal components that are given 
in formula 1.

On the other hand same synthetic vowel can be modelled as the sum of the real part of 5 complex 
exponential signals given in formula 2. (Xk’s are same with ak’s in Table 1 and X0 is the DC 
component, fk’s are the frequency values)

In this homework, we will synthesize this synthetic vowel by using the complex amplitudes 
given in Table 1 for relevant frequency values in MATLAB. We will compute each harmonic 
for 40 mSec and show the contribution of each harmonic separately by plotting the first 
harmonic (for k = 2 only), the sum of first and second harmonics (sum of k = 2 and k = 4), then 
the sum of first, second and third harmonics and etc. As a result, you will obtain a plot like in 
Figure 1. (Choose the Sampling frequency as 20000 Hz)
