# Discrete Convolusion
The Discrete-Time Convolution (DTC) is one of the most 
important operations in a discrete-time signal analysis. 
The operation relates the output sequence y(n) of a linear-time 
invariant (LTI) system, 
with the input sequence x(n) and the unit sample sequence h(n)

## Description
This algorithm calculates the convolution of two discrete-time
signs (x[n] and y[n]) received from the user using the parameters provided. 
- Example: calconv(x,n, y,m). n and m are the number of elements in the array.
- Example: x[n] = [1 2 3] , y[n] = [1 2 3], Result= [1 4 10 12 9]. Underlined and bold values are n=0 point
 Also the result of calconv() functions is compared to the Matlab
pre-defined conv() function.
